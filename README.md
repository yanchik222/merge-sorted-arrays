# merge-sorted-arrays

This project implements a merge method that combines two **already sorted** integer arrays into one sorted array

How it works:
	Uses three pointers to compare elements from both arrays
	Always places the smaller element into the result array
	Copies any remaining elements once one array is exhausted


JUnit tests:
	Equal-sized arrays
	Different-sized arrays
	Duplicates
	Empty and partially empty arrays
